And, well, as of last semester when I took E85, it was one of the best I had taken so far.

I've had to face the first challenge before, but I've yet to take a class that demands high-quality deliverables like that. I see this as an opportunity to dip my feet in to what it's like to be a real engineer. In prior classes like E80 (a project-based systems/electronics/robotics course required for the major), the deliverables were important, but what was more important was our work and learning. In this class, I get the sense that our end-products are the most important--like in most real-world engineering jobs. I love to problem-solve and find creative solutions to difficult problems, but I sometimes have trouble seeing things through to the end and developing high-quality products. I'm excited to take our TA's advice and enjoy this class by putting in the time. There's so much I'm excited to explore, and I can't wait to get into it.","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\nI want to (and am required by my instructor) to start off this blog by discussing my learning goals for this course.
