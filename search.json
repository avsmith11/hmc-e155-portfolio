    "text": "I want to (and am required by my instructor) to start off this blog by discussing my learning goals for this course. First, I’ll talk a bit about why I chose to take this course, then I’ll discuss what I’d like to get out of it. For context for anyone unrelated to Harvey Mudd College, E155 otherwise known as Micro Ps is one of the most feared in the engineering department. This is mostly due to the challenging work and hours and hours of lab-time required every week. However, anyone who’s taken it will also tell you that they learned more in this class than in any other they’ve taken. It follows the concepts of E85: Digital Electronics and Computer Engineering and was recommded for those who enjoyed that class. And, well, as of last semester when I took E85, it was one of the best I had taken so far. This came as no srprise since I’ve always been interested in electronics, especially digital electronics, so when it came time to choose my courses for this semester and microprocessors was offered as an upper-div elective, I decided to take it.\nI expect that this class will be the most demanding I have ever taken, requiring lots of time and expecting high-quality work. I’ve had to face the first challenge before, but I’ve yet to take a class that demands high-quality deliverables like that. I see this as an opportunity to dip my feet in to what it’s like to be a real engineer. In prior classes like E80 (a project-based systems/electronics/robotics course required for the major), the deliverables were important, but what was more important was our work and learning. In this class, I get the sense that our end-products are the most important–like in most real-world engineering jobs. I love to problem-solve and find creative solutions to difficult problems, but I sometimes have trouble seeing things through to the end and developing high-quality products. I’m excited to take our TA’s advice and enjoy this class by putting in the time. There’s so much I’m excited to explore, and I can’t wait to get into it."

    "section": "Design",
    "text": "Design\nThis design used four main modules: a scanner and decoder, a debouncer, a shift register, and a dual segment driver which contains the time mux and segment encoder from last week’s lab. The block diagram for the project is below.\n\nMy first challenge was to design scanning logic to read the pressed button. The keypad has four rows and four columns as shown in the diagram below courtesy of the e155 website.\n\nWhen the i, jth button is pressed, the pins corresponding to the ith column and jth row are connected. I decided I would apply voltage to the rows and measure the columns as inputs. However, voltage cannot be applied to all four rows at the same time since there would be no way to distinguish which row the jth column was connected to. Instead, suppose the FPGA scans one row at a time, applying voltage to each row in quick succession. In that case, the active row and column can be used to determine which button is pressed, and if the scanning rate is sufficiently fast, it is unnoticeable to the user. I designed the FSM below to handle this task.\n\nIn states S0-S3, the corresponding row (rx) is set high and the scanner looks for a button press (indicated by a column going high). If a button push is registered, the state is set to the holding states S4-S7. Otherwise, the pattern S0-&gt;S1-&gt;S2-&gt;S3 continues. Once the FSM is in one of the bottom states, it stays there until no buttons are pushed. I’m using a 5-bit output bus “button”. In the top four states, button is set to 10000 to indicate no button is pressed, and in the bottom four states, the row and column are decoded to the appropriate hexadecimal value and placed in the bottom four bits of button. the top bit is set low in S4-S7 to indicate a button is pressed. This whole FSM ran off an enable signal from a clock divider at ~11kHz - fast enough to be unnoticable by the user, but slow enough that there was no concern of RF effects or parasitic capacitance interfering with operation.\nThe next module I designed was the debouncer. This module handles two of the lab specifications: 1. If multiple buttons are pressed at the same time, only the first one should register 2. A button push should only be registered once In general, a debouncer is a piece of hardware or software the ignores the instability of a switch or button for a short period after it is pressed. This instability is called switch bounce. Since this can occur over a period of 1-5 ms, I decided to measure the bounce of my pin pad using the oscilloscopes in lab. After testing several times, I did not observe any bounce, but I still made the module since it is required for the lab. I designed it as another FSM pictured below. I chose a value on the small end of this scale since choosing a larger debouncing tolerance could result in a noticable input delay.\n\nThis module takes in the button signal set by the scanner and outputs a 4-bit debounced button signal along with a 1-bit pulse. It operates similarly to a step-to-pulse FSM, but includes a counting state before the pulse and holding states. The FSM stays in this state until a button has been pressed for more than 1.4 ms (arbitrary). Then the FSM gives sets deb_button to the bottom four bits of button, generates a 1-clock pulse, and moves to the holding state for as long as a button is held. If at any point button = 10000 indicating no button is pressed, the state is set to waiting.\nI implemented a shift register to store the most recent and previous button presses. The shift register updates when a pulse is received from the debouncer module. The display driver encodes the current and last value given by the shift register to a seven-segment signal and uses time-multiplexing to utilize both displays with one signal plus two enables. The display driver varies from the top module I made last week in two ways: 1. I removed the adder module 2. The clock is passed through as an input and is no longer generated within the module"

    "section": "Testing",
    "text": "Testing\nTo test this project, I designed a test bench for each submodule, as well as one for the top module. None of the test benches were self-checking since it was easy enough to read off the outputs. I’ll explain here what I looked for.\nMy initial tests were full of bugs, but after tracking them all down, here’s what I saw.\n\n\n\nShift Register\n\n\nOn the pulses, the deb_button value is sent to current, and current is sent to last\n\n\n\nDebouncer\n\n\nWhen the button is pressed for more than 1.4ms, deb_button gets button[3:0] and pulse goes high for one clock cycle. If another button is pressed while in the holding state, the press is ignored. If the button is pressed for less than 1.4ms, there is no pulse and no change to deb_button.\n\n\n\nDual Segment Driver\n\n\nThough it’s too small to see in this screenshot, the output seg alternates between the inputs s1 with en1 low (enable signals are active low) and s2 with en2 low. This is all this module is supposed to do.\n\n\n\nScanner and Decoder\n\n\nWhen button = 0000, the rows are switching rapidly as expected, then when some bit of button goes high, the active row stays active and button gets 0xxxx where xxxx is the appropriate hexadecimal value for the active row and column. I had an issue in this module where the fsm would only stay in the bottom states for one clock cycle regardless of input, and by plotting the state signals, I was able to diagnose that there was an issue with my nextstate logic.\n\n\n\nTop\n\n\nIn the top module, we see the same row behavior for column inputs as above. Then, though it can’t be seen in this screenshot, the alternating values of seg match the current and last button presses and match up with the en1 and en2 signals.\nFor robustness, I should have tested inputs where several columns are high at the same time, but I was happy with these results, and it didn’t end up being a problem."

Finally, I wrote a System Verilog module to control a 7-segment hexadecimal display, built the accompanying circuit, and uploaded it to the FPGA.\n\n\n\nI won’t go into much detail about the first few parts, since although they took the majority of my time this week, the process of soldering or learning to use tools is not particularly interesting. Instead, I will focus on the design of the final module.\nThe main goal was to make a program to make a seven-segment representation of a hex digit corresponding to 4 dip switches on the dev board. In addition, we were asked to make one of the onboard LEDs blink at 2.4Hz and two more change their states based on the switch positions.\nThe system verilog for this week was straightforward. First, I figured out how to blink the LED. The lab description suggested we use the configurable high-speed oscillator (HSOSC) on the FPGA. I set the frequency to 24MHz and then created a counter to reset at 10,000,000. Since 24MHz/10,000,000 = 2.4Hz, I made the LED change every time the counter resets.\nThe following is a block diagram of my intended design.\n\nThe truth tables given for the two other onboard LEDs could be represented as an XOR operator on the first two bits and an AND on the second two. This was easily accomplished with assign statements.

Getting QuestaSim to work as expected was more difficult than expected, but after using Radiant’s simulation wizard to create a new QuestaSim project that included the source program and the libraries for the FPGA (which included the HSCOSC module).

I placed a current-limiting resistor at the anode of each segment. This uses more resistors than having on at the common cathode, but ensures the current through each segment does not depend on how many are lit in total. The lab description suggests 5-20mA.

In general, multiplexing can decrease cost since a single piece of hardware can be used for many purposes. Additionally, the sum should be displayed on 5 LEDs."

    "section": "Summary",
    "text": "Summary\nTo meet these goals, I designed the following layout.  The system takes in s1, and s2 (set by the onboard and one external dip-switch) and outputs sum: the sum signal to send to the LEDs, seg: the 7-seg encoded signal for the display, and en1 and en2: enable signals to switch between active displays.\nI chose to switch active displays at F = 1.46kHz (12MHz/2^13) since this is well above the threshold for humans to perceive flickering, but slow enough that hardware issues are not a concern. I decided to implement this with a clock divider since it was the simplest way to implement this functionality. Still, in more complicated sequential designs requiring low-frequency flops, they should take in an enable signal.\nI wrote the top module, created the elements in a Radiant project, and checked the netlist analyzer to ensure it matched my intended design. Sure enough, it did, except for the segment encoder (again, but at this point it will be a running bit since it still works!)\nTop: \nAdder: \nTime Mux: \nSegment Encoder: \nI used QuestaSim to simulate the adder and time_mux modules. After some tweaking, the adder and time multiplexer worked as expected.\nAdder:\nTime Multiplexer: \nSince I had already simulated the encoder last week, I skipped that and went right to simulate the top module. I did some further fixing and tweaking, and it worked as expected (although I forgot to take a screenshot).\nA consideration for this lab, and any FPGA project is how to drive all the necessary hardware without exceeding the current limit of the FPGA pins. The suggested current limit is +/- 8mA. This value is not a strict limit, and as we saw last lab, the current into a pin can reach 15mA-20mA without issue. However, since the common-anode displays must be supplied with much more current than this, two 2N3906 PNP transistors were used to drive the enable signals for the displays. The base signals of the transistors were connected to the FPGA, so current would flow from the collector to the emitter when the FPGA pins were pulled low. 510Ohm resistors were used to limit the 3.3V current through the base node to 5.2mA (I = 510/3.3). I used 470Ohm resistors for the LEDs to get 7.0mA and 150Ohm for the segment display to get 22mA, but since we did that last lab, I know it will work. The schematic for each element is below.\n\nWith the circuit assembled and the logic designed, the FPGA was ready for programming. The system worked as expected for most inputs, but for certain combinations, the left segment display was flickering terribly, and the sum LEDs were inconsistent in their bit assignment. After poking around with Prof. Brake, we determined that the issue lay somewhere in the hardware. After noticing that placing my finger under the breakout cable connections on the bottom of the dev board fixed the flickering issue, I hypothesized that there were floating values somewhere that were fixed by the dielectric of my finger. I changed the internal pull-up resistors to 3.3kOhm, and, like magic (but not really magic), it started working.\nBelow are some pictures of the display and sum working as intended:"

This design challenge was straightforward and mostly easy for me to figure out. However, since this was the first lab of the class, I had to download and setup all of the FPGA/MCU programming, interfacing, and simulation software while using GitHub for the first time in ernest. Between licensing issues, duplicate main/master branches, and MCU firmware issues, it’s not an exaggeration to say this was the most difficult first assignment I’ve ever had. That being said (and I had to write about it somehwere), after navigating this lab, I feel like I can take on anything this class has to throw at me. I’m excited to work with System Verilog (a phrase I never thought I would say) to make real-life designs."
