    "text": "I want to (and am required by my instructor) to start off this blog by discussing my learning goals for this course. First, I’ll talk a bit about why I chose to take this course, then I’ll discuss what I’d like to get out of it. For context for anyone unrelated to Harvey Mudd College, E155 otherwise known as Micro Ps is one of the most feared in the engineering department. This is mostly due to the challenging work and hours and hours of lab-time required every week. However, anyone who’s taken it will also tell you that they learned more in this class than in any other they’ve taken. It follows the concepts of E85: Digital Electronics and Computer Engineering and was recommded for those who enjoyed that class. And, well, as of last semester when I took E85, it was one of the best I had taken so far. This came as no srprise since I’ve always been interested in electronics, especially digital electronics, so when it came time to choose my courses for this semester and microprocessors was offered as an upper-div elective, I decided to take it.\nI expect that this class will be the most demanding I have ever taken, requiring lots of time and expecting high-quality work. I’ve had to face the first challenge before, but I’ve yet to take a class that demands high-quality deliverables like that. I see this as an opportunity to dip my feet in to what it’s like to be a real engineer. In prior classes like E80 (a project-based systems/electronics/robotics course required for the major), the deliverables were important, but what was more important was our work and learning. In this class, I get the sense that our end-products are the most important–like in most real-world engineering jobs. I love to problem-solve and find creative solutions to difficult problems, but I sometimes have trouble seeing things through to the end and developing high-quality products. I’m excited to take our TA’s advice and enjoy this class by putting in the time. There’s so much I’m excited to explore, and I can’t wait to get into it."

    "text": "Time spent: 15 hours\nGitHub Repository\n\n\nThis week, I soldered the dev-board including through-hole and surface-mount technology. I also set up and learned to use the programs used to make this website (Quarto, GitHub) and interface with the FPGA and MCU (QuestaSim, Radiant, Segger, and more GitHub). Finally, I wrote a System Verilog module to control a 7-segment hexadecimal display, built the accompanying circuit, and uploaded it to the FPGA.\n\n\n\nI won’t go into much detail about the first few parts, since although they took the majority of my time this week, the process of soldering or learning to use tools is not particularly interesting. Instead, I will focus on the design of the final module.\nThe main goal was to make a program to make a seven-segment representation of a hex digit corresponding to 4 dip switches on the dev board. In addition, we were asked to make one of the onboard LEDs blink at 2.4Hz and two more change their states based on the switch positions.\nThe system verilog for this week was straightforward. First, I figured out how to blink the LED. The lab description suggested we use the configurable high-speed oscillator (HSOSC) on the FPGA. I set the frequency to 24MHz and then created a counter to reset at 10,000,000. Since 24MHz/10,000,000 = 2.4Hz, I made the LED change every time the counter resets.\nThe following is a block diagram of my intended design.\n\nThe truth tables given for the two other onboard LEDs could be represented as an XOR operator on the first two bits and an AND on the second two. This was easily accomplished with assign statements. Then, I used a case statement to encode the truth table for display outputs.\nOnce this was written, I chased errors mostly due to bad syntax before I imported the file to QuestaSim. Getting QuestaSim to work as expected was more difficult than expected, but after using Radiant’s simulation wizard to create a new QuestaSim project that included the source program and the libraries for the FPGA (which included the HSCOSC module). Since QuestaSim uses a different compiler than Radiant, there were some more syntax issues I needed to fix. After this was done, I used force commands as suggested to set the switch positions and observed the output in the wave view.\n\n\nI had some issues getting the s bus to change value even after force statements, but what I saw made enough sense that I decided to move on. Though I didn’t know it at the time, I had ordered the bits of the 7-segment display opposite of what I wanted, which you can see in the figures above.\nAfter a moderately successful simulation, I looked at the block diagram given by Radiant.\n\nAs you can see, despite the very large number required by the counter, the structure is fairly simple. I was also curious how the seg_driver was interpreted, so I found its schematic. I would expect this block to be some K-map simplified gate array, but instead, I saw this\n\nThis diagram was interesting, and I’d love to learn what Radiant thinks it’s doing here but I decided to move on and trust the process. Prof. Brake suggested that the long binary encodes some information like a lookup table would, but this is clearly not the hardware I implied.\nAt this point, I had already assembled the 7-segment display circuit. The displays we used have a common-cathode design, meaning the display is powered by one pin, and each segment can be toggled by setting its corresponding pin low so current can drain through the LED. I placed a current-limiting resistor at the anode of each segment. This uses more resistors than having on at the common cathode, but ensures the current through each segment does not depend on how many are lit in total. The lab description suggests 5-20mA. I found the value of the resistor with R = 5V/20mA = 250Ohms.\n\nWith the circuit assembled and the pins connected to the FPGA, all that was left was to assign pins (I kept track of the 7-segment display’s pins in a text document in the GitHub repo) and upload to the board. I did this but found that a few things still needed to be fixed.\n\n\n\nFirst Attempt\n\n\nOne segment was not lighting at all as shown in the figure above, and several of the digits were incorrect. I fixed the first issue by changing which pin the segment used. The second issue was caused by the reverse-ordered bits in the seg bus. Once I fixed this, the display was working correctly and met the requirements of the lab. All 16 digits are shown below for your viewing pleasure.\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\n\n\n\n9\n\n\n\n\n\nA\n\n\n\n\n\nb\n\n\n\n\n\nc\n\n\n\n\n\nd\n\n\n\n\n\ne\n\n\n\n\n\nf"

    "text": "Week 1 of this course was deceptively difficult. The main purpose of the lab was to make a seven-segment display controller to represent hex 0-F based on the position of 4 onboard dip-switches. This design challenge was straightforward and mostly easy for me to figure out. However, since this was the first lab of the class, I had to download and setup all of the FPGA/MCU programming, interfacing, and simulation software while using GitHub for the first time in ernest. Between licensing issues, duplicate main/master branches, and MCU firmware issues, it’s not an exaggeration to say this was the most difficult first assignment I’ve ever had. That being said (and I had to write about it somehwere), after navigating this lab, I feel like I can take on anything this class has to throw at me. I’m excited to work with System Verilog (a phrase I never thought I would say) to make real-life designs."
